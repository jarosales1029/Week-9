# Week-9
Honeypots
Deployed 1 honeypot through GCPN - mhn-honeypot-1
The issues I encountered included downloading the JSON files.  I couldn't seem to get the correct permissions to implement the commands correctly through cmd/ssh.  This was remedied by using the GCPN browser and doing the SSH option from the web browser.
There were over 5,000 attacks recorded.  Several different IP addresses from different countries.  My attacks included NMAP calls to see which ports were exploitable.
