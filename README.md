# Week-9
Honeypots
Deployed 3 honeypots (mhn-honeypot-1, mhn-honeypot-2, and mhn-honeypot-3) through GCPN.
The issues I encountered included downloading the JSON files.  I couldn't seem to get the correct permissions to implement the commands correctly through cmd/ssh.  This was remedied by electing the SSH option from within the GCPN web browser.
There were over 5,000 attacks recorded.  Several different IP addresses from different countries.  My attacks included NMAP calls to see which ports were exploitable.  After attempting to go back and record, none of my sensors were working and I could no longer access the MHN server web app.
